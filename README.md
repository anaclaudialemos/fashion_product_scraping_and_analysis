# Web Scraping and Analysis of Fashion Products

â†» Under Construction

## Business Problem
Mariana and Laura are friends and business partners. After several successful businesses, they are planning to enter the US fashion market as an e-commerce business model. 

The initial idea is to enter the market with only one product and for a specific public, i,n this case the product would be jeans for the female public. The goal is to keep the cost of operation low and scale up as they get customers. However, even with the entrance product and the audience defined, the partners have no experience in this fashion market and therefore do not know how to define basic things like price, the type of jeans, and the main materials to manufacture each piece.

So the partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions: 
1. What is the median selling price of jeans? 
2. What are the types of jeans and their colors for the initial products? 
3. What are the product's compositions?

The company's main competitor is H&M.

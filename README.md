## Business Problem
Julia and Mariana are friends and business partners. After several successful businesses, they are planning to enter the US fashion market as an E-commerce business model.

The initial idea is to enter the market with only one product and for a specific public, in this case the product would be jeans for the female public. The goal is to keep the cost of operation low and scale up as they get customers. However, even with the entrance product and the audience defined, the partners have no experience in this fashion market and therefore do not know how to define basic things such as price, the type of jeans and the material main material to manufacture each piece.

So the partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions: 
1. What is the best selling price for the jeans?
2. How many types of jeans and their colors for the initial product?
3. What raw materials are needed to make the jeans?
